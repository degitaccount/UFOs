# UFOs

# Overview
This website provides users with a dynamic table from which to select up to five criteria for obtaining information regarding UFO sightings across the US and Canada.

## Results
Anyone interest in learning about the UFO sighting data on the website may do by following the instructions outlined below.  The website is simple to navigated, however if the instructions are not followed the user may not get the desired output.

## Summary
A major drawback to the website design is that users will not know the available underlying values when entering their search criteria to filter the data.  I recommended two functionality enhancements to improve the user experience:

1. Change the input fields to drop down lists that show the available values
2. Add sorting capability to each column to allow for more flexible data exploration

In addition, I suggest given the site a more professional look and feel by the data to more common formats (e.g. dates in MM/DD/YYYY, sates in capital letters).
